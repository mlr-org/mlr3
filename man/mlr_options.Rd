\usage{
mlr_options()
}
\description{
The following options are currently understood by mlr3:
\itemize{
\item \code{mlr3.verbose}: Set to \code{FALSE} to suppress output of informational messages.
\item \code{mlr3.debug}: Set to \code{TRUE} to enable extra output and additional (potentially expensive) assertions.
\item \code{mlr3.use.future}: Set to \code{FALSE} to disable parallelization via \pkg{future}.
Explicitly disabling this simplifies debugging.
}
}
\examples{
# get a list of currently set options (without the prefix)
mlr_options()
}
