#' @title Prediction Object for Classification
#'
#' @include Prediction.R
#'
#' @description
#' This object wraps the predictions returned by a learner of class [LearnerClassif], i.e.
#' the predicted response and class probabilities.
#'
#' If the response is not provided during construction, but class probabilities are,
#' the response is calculated from the probabilities: the class label with the highest
#' probability is chosen. In case of ties, a label is selected randomly.
#'
#' @note
#' If this object is constructed manually, make sure that the factor levels for `truth`
#' have the same levels as the task, in the same order.
#' In case of binary classification tasks, the positive class label must be the first level.
#'
#' @section Thresholding:
#' If probabilities are stored, it is possible to change the threshold which determines the predicted class label.
#' Usually, the label of the class with the highest predicted probability is selected.
#' For binary classification problems, such an threshold defaults to 0.5.
#' For cost-sensitive or imbalanced classification problems, manually adjusting the threshold can increase
#' the predictive performance.
#'
#' * For binary problems only a single threshold value can be set.
#'   If the probability exceeds the threshold, the positive class is predicted.
#'   If the probability equals the threshold, the label is selected randomly.
#' * For binary and multi-class problems, a named numeric vector of thresholds can be set.
#'   The length and names must correspond to the number of classes and class names, respectively.
#'   To determine the class label, the probabilities are divided by the threshold.
#'   This results in a ratio > 1 if the probability exceeds the threshold, and a ratio < 1 otherwise.
#'   Note that it is possible that either none or multiple ratios are greater than 1 at the same time.
#'   Anyway, the class label with maximum ratio is selected.
#'   In case of ties in the ratio, one of the tied class labels is selected randomly.
#'
#'   Note that there are the following edge cases for threshold equal to `0` which are handled specially:
#'   1. With threshold 0 the resulting ratio gets `Inf` and thus gets always selected.
#'      If there are multiple ratios with value `Inf`, one is selected according to `ties_method` (randomly per default).
#'   2. If additionally the predicted probability is also 0, the ratio `0/0` results in `NaN` values.
#'      These are simply replaced by `0` and thus will never get selected.

    #' Creates a new instance of this [R6][R6::R6Class] class.

    #' @param task ([TaskClassif])\cr
    #'   Task, used to extract defaults for `row_ids` and `truth`.
    #'
    #' @param row_ids (`integer()`)\cr
    #'   Row ids of the predicted observations, i.e. the row ids of the test set.
    #'
    #' @param truth (`factor()`)\cr
    #'   True (observed) labels. See the note on manual construction.
    #'
    #' @param response (`character()` | `factor()`)\cr
    #'   Vector of predicted class labels.
    #'   One element for each observation in the test set.
    #'   Character vectors are automatically converted to factors.
    #'   See the note on manual construction.
    #'
    #' @param prob (`matrix()`)\cr
    #'   Numeric matrix of posterior class probabilities with one column for each class
    #'   and one row for each observation in the test set.
    #'   Columns must be named with class labels, row names are automatically removed.
    #'   If `prob` is provided, but `response` is not, the class labels are calculated from
    #'   the probabilities using [max.col()] with `ties.method` set to `"random"`.
    #'
    #' @param check (`logical(1)`)\cr
    #'   If `TRUE`, performs some argument checks and predict type conversions.
