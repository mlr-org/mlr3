#' @param average (`character(1)`)\cr
#'   How to average multiple [Prediction]s from a [ResampleResult].
#'
#'   The default, `"macro"`, calculates the individual performances scores for each [Prediction] and then uses the
#'   function defined in `aggregator` to average them to a single number.
#'
#'   If set to `"micro"`, the individual [Prediction] objects are first combined into a single new [Prediction] object which is then used to assess the performance.
#'   The function `aggregator` is not used in this case.
