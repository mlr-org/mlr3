# Segfaulting Learners

We now consider learners which generate a segfault, tearing down the complete R session.

```{r}
task = mlr_tasks$get("classif.iris")
learner = mlr_learners$get("classif.crashtest")
learner$param_vals = list(crash.mode = "segfault", crash.on = "train")

e = Experiment$new(task, learner)
```

The trick is to do the learning in an independent R session.
We do this by selecting a future backend which spawns a new R session:
```{r}
library("future")
library("future.callr")
plan("callr", timeout = 10)
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
options(future.wait.timeout = 3)
ctrl = mlr_control(error_handling = "catch")
e$train(ctrl = ctrl)
```
