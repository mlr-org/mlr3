Multiple discrete columns may role. \"weight\": Observation weights. one numeric column may role. col_roles named list whose elements named column role element character() vector column names. alter roles, just modify list, e.g. R's set functions (intersect(), setdiff(), union(), ...). method $set_col_roles provides convenient alternative assign columns roles. nrow (integer(1)) Returns total number rows role \"use\". ncol (integer(1)) Returns total number columns role \"target\" \"feature\". feature_types (data.table::data.table()) Returns table columns id type id column names \"active\" features task type storage type. data_formats character() Vector supported data output formats. specific format can chosen $data() method. strata (data.table::data.table()) task columns designated role \"stratum\", returns table one subpopulation per row two columns: N (integer()) number observations subpopulation, row_id (list integer()) list column row ids respective subpopulation. Returns NULL stratification variable. See Resampling information stratification. groups (data.table::data.table()) task column designated role \"group\", table two columns: row_id (integer()), grouping variable group (vector()). Returns NULL grouping column. See Resampling information grouping. order (data.table::data.table()) task least one column designated role \"order\", table two columns: row_id (integer()), ordering vector order (integer()). Returns NULL order column. weights (data.table::data.table()) task column designated role \"weight\", table two columns: row_id (integer()), observation weights weight (numeric()). Returns NULL weight column. labels (named character()) Retrieve labels (prettier formated names) columns. Internally queries column label table field col_info.
